🎧📽️ Exploring Video and Audio Datasets with Python
This project focuses on exploring, preprocessing, and analyzing video and audio datasets using Python. It leverages popular libraries like Librosa, MoviePy, and Torchaudio to prepare media data for a variety of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as speech recognition, audio classification, and video analysis.

🔍 Project Goals
Load and explore various video/audio datasets

Preprocess and clean media data

Extract relevant audio/video features

Build foundations for ML/AI tasks like:

Speech recognition

Audio classification

Emotion detection

Video segmentation and classification

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
Python 3.x

Librosa – Audio analysis

MoviePy – Video editing and processing

Torchaudio – Deep learning for audio with PyTorch

OpenCV – Computer vision and video frame processing

NumPy – Array and signal operations

Matplotlib – Visualizations
